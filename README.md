# Christmas Tree Coordinates

This flask/p5.js app allows manual calculation and rendering of LED 3D coordinates taken from two camera angles of a Christmas Tree. 

This requires two collections of images, in the ```static/assets/x-y``` and ```static/assets/z-y``` directories, which will be used to display in the app.

You'll can then select where you think the LED is, for the image from each angle.

Results are written to a csv file, which is then used for rendering.
